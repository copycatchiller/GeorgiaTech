##Strong Inference

To achieve Strong Inference we follow these steps:
  1. Devising a number of alternative hypotheses.
  1. Devising an experiment with alternative possible outcomes that exclude one or more of the hypotheses.
  1. Carrying out the experiment to a clean result.
  1. Recycling the procedure, making subhypotheses and refining.

*Independent Variable* --> some factor that is set in varying amounts by the experimenter.     
*Dependent Variable* --> factor that changes (or not) as a result of changing the Independent Variable.  
*Positive Control* --> experiments with *known* outcomes.  
*Negative Control* --> experiments with *null or no* outcomes.
